# Friendly_AI_Genetic_Algorith
This code represents a friendly AI agent in a game environment. It is designed to exhibit various behaviors and capabilities to enhance its intelligence and interaction with the game world.

The FriendlyAI class is responsible for controlling the behavior of the AI agent.
The class includes variables for the neural network, biological components (health, energy, age, hunger), and parameters for reproduction and resource management.
The Start() function initializes the neural network and biological components.
The Update() function is called every frame and performs the main logic for the AI agent:
It updates the inputs for the neural network based on the AI's current state.
The neural network processes the inputs and produces outputs that influence the AI's movement.
The AI moves based on the outputs and performs actions such as defending against danger, reproducing, consuming energy, and regenerating health and energy.
Additionally, the AI incorporates the behaviors you requested:
Pathfinding: It utilizes a Pathfinding component to navigate through the game environment by following a path.
Task Prioritization: It uses a TaskManager component to manage and prioritize tasks.
Adaptive Strategy: It adjusts its behavior based on the current strategy, which is obtained from a Strategy component.
Memory and Learning: It utilizes a MemorySystem component to store and recall past experiences.
Social Dynamics: It interacts with other AI agents through a SocialDynamics component, modeling relationships and alliances.
Resource Management: It manages its resources through a ResourceManager component, prioritizing resource acquisition and conservation.
Contextual Decision-Making: It considers the context of the current situation using a ContextManager component, adapting behavior based on factors like time of day or nearby objects.
Multi-Agent Coordination: It coordinates actions with other AI agents through a MultiAgentCoordinator component, enabling communication and cooperation.
Goal Reasoning: It reasons about its goals and modifies them based on changing circumstances using a GoalReasoning component.
Ethical Decision-Making: It makes decisions based on ethical considerations using an EthicalDecisionMaker component.
The TrainAI() function is intended for training the AI agent using a genetic algorithm or similar methods, but it is currently empty.
The remaining private functions handle specific tasks such as checking for danger, defending, calculating fitness, reproducing, consuming energy, checking hunger, and regenerating health and energy.
The NeuralNetwork class represents a basic neural network implementation with feed-forward functionality. It includes a Clone() function for creating a clone of the neural network.
